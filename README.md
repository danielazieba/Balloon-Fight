# Balloon-Fight
My final project in Computational Problem Solving, Balloon Fight: Mathematica recreates the NES classic Balloon Fight using Mathematica graphics. My partner for this project was Bronson McQueen.
The notebooks should be evaluated in this order:
1: GameModeOne.nb 
2: GenerateGameModeTwo.nb
3: GenerateTrip.nb
4: RunGameCode.nb
